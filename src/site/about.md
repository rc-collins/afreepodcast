## What is this show all about?

It's a movie podcast. Each season we look at a different set of movies. Season 1 was about cinematic failsons. Season 2 is about fears and phobias.

## Who are the Midnight Boys?

A nickname for the hosts. They previously hosted <a href="http://tombstoneminute.com/">Tombstone Minute</a> and <a href="http://titanicminute.com/">Titanic Minute</a>. They are now working on <a href="http://forrestgumpminute.com/">Forrest Gump Minute</a>.

During college, we would stay up until all hours of the morning watching movies. This led to Rob’s girlfriend (now wife) dubbing us the Midnight Boys.

Joe is a respected educator. Rob is a guy that builds websites. Duff is a public servant/moocher. We attended UW-Madison together some 15 years ago and decided there aren’t enough podcasts of guys dissecting mainstream entertainment.

## How can I support the show?
We have a patreon! You <a href="http://patreon.com/themidnightboys/">can sign up</a> and for as little as $2 get access to a monthly patreons only show called A Paid Podcast.

We also have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/afplisteners">Facebook group</a> you can join to interact with the hosts and other fans of the show.

## Cool cover art. Who made it?

That is all the work of <a href="http://www.alinaruppel.com/">Alina Ruppel</a>. She does good work.

## What's with the theme music?

The AFP theme is taken from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEMucxvcMcY">General Cinema bumper</a> that ran in the late ’80s and early ’90s. It was also parodied on <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnhFhd1nGlA">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>.
